# Memories and Miles

Static Blazor WebAssembly site for planning Disney, Universal, and cruise vacations. Built with Blazorise components for a calm, laid-back feel. It includes:

- Home page introducing the travel services.
- Questionnaire to help choose a destination.
- Contact form that opens an email to laura@whitneyworldtravel.com.

Build the site:

```bash
 dotnet build
```
